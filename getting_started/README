1. Install apache2

  The VMs dont have apache installed so we need to install it: 

    >>> sudo apt-get install apache2

  This will create a directory: /var/www/ and if we visit http://localhost/ in our browsers we should see: "It works!"



2. Upgrading Node.js

  We need to upgrade node.js to version ~ 4.* and I've written a script to do it: 

    >>> sh install-node.sh 



3. Install npm 

    >>> curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh



4. Get the workshop code from git hub 

    >>> git clone git@github.com:chelm/FOSS4G-Node.js-and-Polymaps-Workshop.git

    >>> mv FOSS4G-Node.js-and-Polymaps-Workshop /var/www/foss4g 

    >>> cd /var/www/foss4g
